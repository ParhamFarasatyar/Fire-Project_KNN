# 🔥 Fire Detection using KNN  

This project is a **machine learning-based fire detection system** that classifies images as either **Fire** or **No Fire** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.  

The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective solution for detecting fire in images, which can be useful in **forest monitoring, surveillance systems, and safety applications**.
